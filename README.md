Summary

This is a To Do list that keeps track of tasks to be completed, completed tasks, and allows you to input new tasks.
It is built using React and pulls in a list of tasks using an API.
As of 07/16/2024, this doesn't have the backend feature nor store data to the localStorage or uses Redux, so the data refreshes when the page refreshes.
